#### Notation

src: https://www.arroway-textures.ch/en/faq-categories/using-our-products

We understand, that our naming convention for map files can seem confusing at first glance. Here is how to read them:

Every notation consists of a character specifying the channel, as well as three digits giving a numerical setting. - x###
The first notation gives the primary purpose of a map. - name_x###
For some map several purposes might be specified. - _x###_y###_z###
Parenthesis remark a fixed value. - (x###)
Channels

D - Diffuse color, B - Bump, P - Displacement, S - Specularity, G - Glossiness, R - Reflectivity, O - Opacity, A - Anisotropy.

Some examples

d100: "This is the diffuse color map of the texture; to be used at full channel effect strength"
b030: "This is the bump map; the recommended strength is 30%."
s050: "The specularity map; the recommended strength is 50%."
(g025): "Instead of a map, you may specify a fixed glossiness value of 25%."
p010: "The displacement map; real-world relief depth is 10mm."
With this notation you can see directly what a map is, how it relates to other maps and what recommended setting are - all without the need to consult the catalog.
